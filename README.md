RK-Opt is a collection of MATLAB codes for designing optimized numerical ODE solvers.
The main emphasis is on Runge-Kutta methods, but some routines deal with other classes of methods.
It is primarily developed and used by the
[KAUST Numerical Mathematics Group](http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa).
It includes the following sub-packages:

 - **polyopt**: Find optimal stability polynomials of a given degree and order of
   accuracy for a specified spectrum.
 - **RK-coeff-opt**: Find optimal Runge-Kutta method coefficients, for a prescribed
   order of accuracy and number of stages.
 - **am_rad-opt**: Find stability functions with optimal radius of absolute monotonicity.
   Includes capabilities for both multistep and multistage methods.
 - **RKtools**: A collection of routines for analyzing or computing various
   properties of Runge-Kutta methods.  For a much more extensive package along these
   lines, see [NodePy](http://nodepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

A common workflow for designing Runge-Kutta methods is to use **polyopt** to find an
appropriate stability function and then **RK-coeff-opt** to determine the Runge-Kutta
method coefficients.

To run the tests, execute the MATLAB script `test.m`. This requires a relatively recent
version of MATLAB (tested with R2018a and later) with the following toolboxes.
 - MATLAB Optimization Toolbox
 - MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox
 - CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/)
 - MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox (optional; allows faster searching for optimal methods in RK-Coeff-Opt)
